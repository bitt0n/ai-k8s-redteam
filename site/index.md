# AI Ã— Kubernetes Red Teaming

Documentation for tools and checks used in AI/LLM security testing and Kubernetes offensive validation.

## Tracks
- [AI Pentesting](ai/index.md): prompt injection, RAG abuse, vector threats, and data leakage tests.
- [Kubernetes Offense](k8s/index.md): RBAC visualization, bad-pod admission tests, and cluster enumeration.

## Scope
All examples are intended for authorized environments. Many tests are designed to fail on hardened setups to validate controls.
