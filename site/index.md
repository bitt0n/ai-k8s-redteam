# AI Ã— Kubernetes Red Teaming

Quiet, useful research. No hype.

## Tracks
- [AI Pentesting](ai/index.md): prompt injection, RAG abuse, vector threats, data leakage.
- [Kubernetes Offense](k8s/index.md): RBAC privesc, bad pods, lateral movement, covert exfil.

## Ethos
Operate legally, think deeply, ship small practical tools weekly.
